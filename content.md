🎯 Beginner Level in Grammar
Would you like to learn the language of the Qur’an with ease and clarity, and understand its rules from their authentic source?
 Start here, where your journey with the language begins from its earliest foundations—you learn sentence structure, word categories, and parsing step by step.
📗 Fayḍ Rabb al-Barīyah: Explanation of al-Ājurrūmiyyah with Qur’anic Evidences
The text of al-Ājurrūmiyyah is among the most famous educational texts in Arabic grammar.
My book “Fayḍ Rabb al-Barīyah” presents a simplified explanation of its chapters, using Qur’anic examples only, so that the learner remains connected to the speech of Allah and finds ease in understanding the foundational rules.
📘 Al-As-Hum al-Dhahabiyyah: Summary of al-Ājurrūmiyyah with Qur’anic Evidences
Then comes the book “Al-Al-Ashum al-Dhahabiyyah” as your companion for review and mastery.
 It is the distilled essence of what you studied in “Fayḍ Rabb al-Barīyah”, with rules presented in concise tables and mirrored pages that pair the text with its explanation, keeping the complete picture clear in your mind.
Begin with Fayḍ Rabb al-Barīyah for understanding and reflection, then move to Al-Ashum al-Dhahabiyyah for review and mastery.

🎯 Intermediate Level in Grammar
📘 Al-Hadiyyah fī al-Qawāʿid al-Naḥwiyyah bil-Shawāhid al-Qur’āniyyah
Arabic is the noblest and most beneficial of languages for humanity, and it suffices it as an honor that the Qur’an was revealed in it.
My book “Al-Hadiyyah” presents simplified grammar rules in comfortable tables, linking each rule to Qur’anic verses, enabling quick review and firm retention.
It is a “gift” from me to take your hand toward the ease of grammar.
Reasons and motivations for relying on the language of the Qur’an:
The Qur’an is the only Arabic text that continues to be recited correctly through direct oral transmission—teacher to teacher, reciter to reciter—back to the Prophet ﷺ. It represents the classical Arabic language across all its eras.


Teaching a learner grammar through a sacred text they love is better than teaching them texts of this person or that person.
  If, in addition to learning, they are worshipping Allah—reciting His Book—then every letter they pronounce earns ten good deeds. Thus, they are in a state of learning and worship simultaneously.
  Therefore, we learn and obey Allah Almighty.


Note: This book has been approved by the Libraries Department of the Egyptian Ministry of Education for the preparatory and secondary stages.

🎯 Beginner Level in Tajwīd
For those wishing to memorize and recite the Book of Allah:
 This book is the best entry point for beginners in tajwīd.
📗 Fayḍ al-Raḥmān bimā fī Tuḥfat al-Aṭfāl min Aḥkām
This book is a simplified explanation of the poem “Tuḥfat al-Aṭfāl wal-Ghilmān fī Tajwīd al-Qur’ān”.
 It provides clear rules with examples from Juz’ ʿAmma, teaching you how to apply tajwīd rules during recitation. It contains:
· Rules of nūn sākinah and tanwīn
 · Rules of doubled mīm and nūn
 · Rules of mīm sākinah
 · Rules of identical, similar, and close letters
 · Rules of lām of definition and lām of verbs
 · Types of elongation
📘 Al-Mukhtaṣar al-Mufīd fī Jawādil al-Tajwīd
After mastering understanding and application in Fayḍ al-Raḥmān, comes Al-Mukhtaṣar al-Mufīd as your guide for review and reinforcement.
 I chose it for you because it presents tajwīd rules in concise tables, helping you easily review and retain what you learned. You will find:
· Articulation points and characteristics of letters
 · Tafkhīm and tarqīq
 · Rules of identical, similar, and close letters
 · Rules of mīm sākinah and doubled mīm & nūn
 · Rules of elongation
 · Rules of lām of definition and lām of verbs

 · Stopping and starting rules
Begin with Fayḍ al-Raḥmān for understanding and application, then move to Al-Mukhtaṣar al-Mufīd for review and consolidation.

🎯 Advanced Level in Tajwīd
📗 Al-Iʿlām bimā fī al-Muqaddimah al-Jazarīyah min Aḥkām
My book “Al-Iʿlām” is a detailed explanation of the Jazariyyah poem, “Al-Muqaddimah fīmā ʿalā Qārīʾ al-Qur’ān an Yaʿlamah”.
 It is written in service of the Book of Allah, guiding anyone wishing to recite the Qur’an correctly, with a clear explanation of every rule.
I ensured that many examples were selected from Sūrat Yūsuf, al-Kahf, and Maryam — due to their frequent recitation — to make it easier to understand the rules and then apply them across the Qur’an.
📘 Al-Mukhtaṣar al-Mufīd fī Jawādil al-Tajwīd
This book is a concise summary in nine organized sheets, simplifying the most important tajwīd rules for quick and clear review.
 It is a practical continuation of Al-Iʿlām, helping learners firmly retain and visually review the rules.
Begin with Al-Iʿlām for detailed understanding, then proceed to Al-Mukhtaṣar al-Mufīd for review and mastery, enabling correct application of tajwīd rules during recitation.

🎯 Advanced Level in Grammar
This level combines two books:
· First: Al-Hadiyyah, which directly links the rules to the Qur’an, enhancing practical application and deep understanding.
 · Second: Arabic Grammar from the Speech of the Messenger ﷺ, which offers a faith-based educational experience tied to the Prophet’s biography and authentic hadith.
📘 Al-Hadiyyah fī al-Qawāʿid al-Naḥwiyyah bil-Shawāhid al-Qur’āniyyah
Arabic is the noblest and most beneficial language for humanity, and it suffices it as honor that the Qur’an was revealed in it.
My book presents simplified grammar rules in tables that link each rule to Qur’anic examples, making review and mastery easy.
Reasons for relying on the Qur’anic language (repeated here in the second mention):
The Qur’an is the only Arabic text still recited correctly through continuous oral transmission back to the Prophet ﷺ.


Teaching through a sacred text is more effective, and the recitation of each letter is rewarded with ten good deeds — combining learning and worship.


Note: This book is approved by the Libraries Department of the Egyptian Ministry of Education for preparatory and secondary levels.
📗 Grammar for Beginners from the Speech of the Messenger ﷺ – Seven Parts

Features of the two books in the advanced level:
